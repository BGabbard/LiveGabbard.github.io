    <p>It reminds me of one summer day in the park. I was having just a delightful picnic with my good friend Orville. And I said to him, I said, "Orville&copy;, I... I have a story." And he said to me, <br>"What's the significance of the story?" And... I said to him, "Orville&copy;, not every story has to have significance, y'know? Sometimes, a... y'know, sometimes, a story's just a story. You try to read into every little thing, and find meaning in everything anyone says, <i>you'll just drive yourself crazy</i>. Had a friend do it once. <b>Wasn't pretty</b>. We talked about it for years. And then not only that, but... you'll likely end up believing something you shouldn't believe, thinking something you shouldn't think, o-o-or assuming something you shouldn't assume. <b>Y'know</b>? Sometimes," I said, "A story is-is just a story, so just be quiet for one second of your life and eat your sandwich, okay?"</p> 
    <p>Of course, it was only then I'd realized I'd made sandwiches, and... poor Orville&copy; was having such difficulty eating it! Elephants have those clumsy hands, y'know? Actually, I-I suppose that's the problem. They don't have hands at all, do they? <i>They're fâ€”they're all feet</i>! And I-I couldn't imagine someone asking me to eat a sandwich with my feet. Now, if I recall correctly, there was a bakery nearby. I said to him, "Orville&copy;, let me go get you some rye bread." Now, I'm unsure if elephants enjoy rye bread, but I assure you that Orville does. Now, this was on a Tuesday, which was good, because rye bread was always fresh on Tuesday. They made sourdough bread on Monday, and threw it out Wednesday&mdash;Or rather, they sold it at a discount for people wanting to feed it to the ducks, and then, prob'ly at the end of the day, finally, they threw it all out. I-I don't recall. I do remember a man who would bring his son to the bakery every Wednesday, and... then go feed the ducks.</p>
